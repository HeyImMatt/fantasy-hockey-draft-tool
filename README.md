**Created by: Matt McFarland**

This is a work-in-progress tool that uses the NHL API to get player stats. The intention is to be able to apply an algorithm that will give players a rating based on how much they will help your fantasy hockey team given a particular league scoring format. This can then be used to stack rank players to help you with who to pick next during draft day.
